2 Apr 2024

Aims
----

- Overall plan for learning resources
- Specific plans for producing tutorials quickly
- How to make tutorials as useful as possible

Needs
-----

- Tutorials are effective
- Tutorials are enjoyable
- Graded logical progression
- All self-contained as far as possible so can dip in
- Suit different learning styles
- Present same tutorial in different ways to support user choice of learning style
- Allow future improvements to presentation without re-writing tutorials
- Tutorials are quick to produce
- Tutorials are easy to update
- Tutorials readable outside the studio
- Tutorial functionality merges into how-to wizards usable at any time
- Tutorial functionality can be used by Elemento devs to produce tutorials for their apps

Forces
------

- Recorded video and audio is time-consuming and inflexible
- Changing the sequence of pages is difficult with hard-coded next/previous
- Experience will probably show many improvements to tutorial presentation
- Linking tutorials to a GitHub project may not be the best route
- How to use files eg for data if Tutorial not in a Project?

Issues
------

- Should Tutorials always be within their own project, or able to be shown in the tools page of any project you are working on
- How will a Tutorial about working with projects work?
- What if want to call up a tutorial to help with one specific task, eg creating a list?


Possibilities
-------------

- Game elements to tutorials
- Points for ones completed
- Points for progress through tutorial
- Points for mistakes made and corrected
- Data-driven tutorials
- Components for tutorial steps and pages
- Audio with user control of steps and/or auto-run
- Guide for each tutorial
- Guide shown in panel/iframe beside the steps
- Scroll to section in guide on each step
- Starter project elements in the tutorial, can be inserted into project
- Files can/should belong to app, not project
- Tools can be top level apps exported from project
- Tools can be imported from other projects
- Can auto import and run any tutorial/tool without defining it as an import
