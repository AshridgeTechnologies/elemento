App customisation
=================

22 Apr 2024

Aims
----

- Allow easy customisation by _users_ of Elemento-based apps

Use cases
---------

- Language trainer question generation
- Maths question generation
- Macro facility for business apps
- Game question generation



Needs
-----

- Custom functions for use by one user
- Custom functions to be shared by other users
- Security to avoid bad things for people using another's custom functions
- Use other facilities of the app
- Use only a restricted set of facilities
- Use Elemento formula language

Forces
------

- The language trainer is a rare example of needing to generate data according to complex rules
- Allowing user input of code rightly arouses huge suspicion of the risks

Possibilities
-------------


Decisions
---------

- Don't pursue this for now
