Using existing React components
===============================

Aims
----

- Make it quick and easy to use existing React components in Elemento

Needs
-----

- Add components to specific projects OR for all
- Use alongside the current higher-level convenience components
- Properties can be set in the editor
- Property types are correct
- Property values/expressions appear in generated code
- Properties may not be mapped directly eg width to sx.width
- Generate from PropertyTypes with manual overrides
- Store app state alongside the component where needed
- Handle events to store state
- With MUI components that have loads of styling properties, don't let them confuse less experienced users
