Versioning with GitHub
======================

Aims
----

- Make it easy for developers to work with different versions of a Project

Needs
-----

- Versioning is not essential - default is to use latest GitHub commit
- Preview a new version before publishing
- Use multiple versions newer or older than one currently published
- Set a newer or older version as published
- Versioning available in both run from GitHub and Firebase
- All asset files are versioned
- Server apps are also versioned
- Files of each version can be indefinitely cached, except maybe index.html
- Easy to see which versions are available, which is current
- Easy to set current version
