Rich text
=========

Aims
----

- Developer can easily edit areas of formatted text
- Elemento becomes useful for a wider range of apps
- Help and Tutorial tools can include explanatory text

Needs
-----

- Single Text element can contain lengthy text with multiple styles
- Rich text element can include inline calculated values
- Rich text element can include inline elements that perform actions in the app


Later
-----

- Rich text inputs in User apps 

Forces
------

- Don't want to use limited hacks to include templated values or actions
- Want to keep things consistent with general app construction
- Storing the HTML generated by the rich text editor in the model would be best
  - especially as need to feed it back in for updating
- Including normal HTML in React has some difficulties - could use dangerouslySet..
- Normal HTML with embedded React components has difficulties - need to have it all as React
- React has all the flexibility to include generated text or elements inside others
- Treating the HTML as JSX and converting to React would make embedding easier

Possibilities
-------------

- Rich text can have placeholders
- Placeholders can be expressions from the context
- Rich text elements in the model can have children
- Placeholders can refer to children of the element
- Convert rich text HTML (as JSX) on the fly at runtime
- Convert rich text HTML (as JSX) in the generator
- Generate JSX and run it all through a translator

Decisions
---------

- Rich text elements are different to normal Text elements
- Rich text elements can have children
- Placeholders in the rich text can refer to any expression or a child element
- Generator treats rich text HTML as JSX and converts to nested createElement calls
