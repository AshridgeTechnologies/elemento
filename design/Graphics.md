Graphics
========

Aims
----

- Make it easy to create apps with graphics

Use case examples
-----------------

- Simple action game - eg space invaders, candy-crush
- Board game - cards, word games, counter games
- Educational - eg physics or maths simulation
- Custom designs - customer enters specific details, generates image
- Business - data illustrations


Needs
-----

- Can show shapes, lines, icons, images, text
- Can mix with normal controls - even overlaying
- Can control position and all other properties
- Response is fast enough for simple games
- Follow same functional principles as everything else
- Similar DX to text-oriented elements
- Can create components using lower-level eg a deck of cards
- Drag and drop - position state properties _and_ events

Possibilities
-------------

- HTML elements with absolute positioning
- SVG elements
- Canvas
- Graphics components are put into a container as text ones, but not positioned automatically
- Ordering may control z-order
- All properties are formulas
- Position functions eg x away from another position at 45 degrees
- Draggable elements have a position value
- Drop action - on container, dropped element, drop target? Or all of them?
