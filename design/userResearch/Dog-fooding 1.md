Observations from building example apps
---------------------------------------

- Not clear how to find the current page (CurrentUrl.page not guessable)
- Being able to evaluate any expression in the Inspector is a must
- Being able to watch one or more expressions in the Inspector is very useful - care with actions
- Being able to highlight an expression in a property on editor and see its value in inspector (or in the editor) would be very useful
- Being able to run an action in the Inspector very useful
- Using theme colors and others is useful, needs documenting
- If you get 'Unable to display the app...' you really need to know where the error is
- It's very easy to enter a formula in a property and forget to switch it to a formula
- Searching props (esp style props), highlighting/showing ones with values, formulas would all be useful
- You need to be able to debug inside user-defined functions when they are called
- Confusing why you can't just use a Collection attached to a DataStore as a list and use it with RandomFrom - need to go via another collection with a Query({})
- Need to reupload files without relaoding whole project (and initial upload bug in not copying to dist)
