----------------------

- Tutorial page scrolls down every time you focus on another part of the page
- Not clear where had got to in the steps on each page
- Show me for properties panel highlights the preview and all the different properties
- Concepts of Properties and Properties Panel not obvious - or element
- Suggest working through before doing Show Me
- Typed own name instead of "Your Name"
- Did not like having the formula typed automatically before had chance to enter it
  - would have preferred being shown the right box and entering the formula as separate steps
- Would have liked more explanation, so long as could choose to ignore
- Suggest playing with properties after completing the tutorial
- Comic Sans doesn't work as Font Family
- When changed the name of the Your Name element, things stopped working, no indication why
- Unknown names error message not very intuitive
