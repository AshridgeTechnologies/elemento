Getting Started User Test
=========================

18 Feb 2024

Aims
----

- User trial of product
- Assess general level of ease of use, learning
- Assess usefulness of Getting Started Tutorial

Users
-----

- ML - user, non-programmer, computer-uneasy
- PB - observer

Procedure
---------

- Observe user finding and working through tutorial from elemento.online home page
- Observer gave occasional prompts
- Environment: elemento.online in Edge on Windows laptop IdeaPad S340 - probably 1366x768 resolution

Observations
------------

- Screen size a bit too small for the tutorial
- Scrollbars appeared on several sections of the page
- Previous and Next buttons not visible even on first page
- User did not think of scrolling down the tutorial section even though a scroll bar was visible
- User did some parts with the Show me, some just worked out
- User did not remember which parts were the Navigator, Properties Panel and Preview even after the explanation
- User missed out one or two steps, had to be prompted - difficult to see which you have done
- Tutorial completed in under 10 mins
- User would probably have got stuck without prompts from the observer


Points for improvement
----------------------

- Fixed titles on the three parts of the screen
- Title bar on tutorial with Previous and Next
- Scroll down prompt
- Flash the highlight a few times to make more obvious
- Not clear where had got to in the steps on each page
- Concepts of Properties and Properties Panel not obvious - or element
- Suggest working through before doing Show Me
