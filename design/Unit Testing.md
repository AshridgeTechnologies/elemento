============

19 Aug 24

Aims
----

- Easy way for devs to create unit tests
- Make debugging easier
- Act as regression tests
- Form a base for wider-scope functional testing

Needs
-----

- Easy to create
- Easy to run

Forces
------

- Most functions end up using values from the page or app
- Not sure where the best place to keep tests is - 
  - in the page or app, hidden
  - in a separate area of the project
  - in a Tool
- May need multiple set up and multiple assert

Issues
------
- How to test in a context and set up values
- How or where to display results

Possibilities
-------------

- Auto create a test context with the names and values used in the function
