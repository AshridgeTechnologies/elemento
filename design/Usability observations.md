Usability observations
======================

- Having no ability to debug values is infuriating
- Seeing what happens when an action is triggered is also essential
- Constructing a record field by field is tedious
- Not being able to force reload the preview is annoying
- Setting up a database maintenance screen is fiddly - the model-generated component will be a game-changer
- Being able to search and replace and/or rename automatically, would be very useful
- Not being able to see which elements have errors is pants
- Need either a Random Number element or a RandomNumber function to get a random integer
- Need a Size function to get length of a collection
- Getting a random element from a collection is hard 
- Random function could do any of: pick from arg list, pick from an array, pick from a collection, pick a random integer between 0 and a single given value, random fraction 0 to 1 with no args
- Could also have a Random number element that gives the same number until it is Reset
- Need to be able to try out functions with literal data
- Need to be able to try out functions with other values in the app
- Need to be able to evaluate any expression at any time
- Need built-in functions for Any, Every on arrays
