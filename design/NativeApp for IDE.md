NativeApp for IDE
=================

Aims
----

- Consider whether to switch to a native app for running the IDE

Problems with browser-based IDE
-------------------------------

- Working with services like Firebase using standard dev tools
- Running native tools for packaging
- Storing working codebase in browser-internal filesystem, with import/export
- Running and quickly updating server functions for dev and test
- Debugging server functions
- Unusual experience for devs

Forces
------

- Downloading an app is more friction
- Maintaining a web version of the IDE as well is an overhead
- Learning a new tool is a big overhead
