General usability Part 1
========================

- Form controls all go on their own row
- Width attributes and/or full width controls inc multiline
- Highlight selected element in running app
- Can't insert unless select an item
- Click on running app to select element
- Inputs can have undefined value
- Number input is type number and can also be undefined
- Input adornment of = in Fx mode
- Change to formula if type = at the start
- Nav tree like power apps:  full width, menu at right, highlight and menu on hover
- Copy/paste before/after on context menu
- Insert before/after on context menu
- Have fixed kind buttons non-disables but warn if try to change
- Icons on Insert Menu
- Reset function acts on whole page
- Data store has type and enforces it
- Review what the value of a control should be in a formula if not set - same as React element, undefined, null, empty string?
