========================

- Duplicate names are highlighted and handled sensibly without losing state (eg add a suffix to one name)
- Data store has type and enforces it
- Alt-hover over running app highlights the elements
- Input adornment of = in Fx mode
- Change to formula if type = at the start
- Nav tree like power apps:  full width, menu at right, highlight and menu on hover
- Have fixed kind buttons non-disables but warn if try to change
- Icons on Insert Menu
