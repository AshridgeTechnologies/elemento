Formula improvements Part 3
===========================

- If() has expressions transformed to functions so they are not evaluated unless needed
- Value Formulas can have multiple named sub-formulas used in the result
- Action formulas can have steps with the result of each step assigned to a name if required
- Action formulas are async and each step is done with await
- Need either a Random Number element or a RandomNumber function to get a random integer
- Random function to do any of: 
  - pick from arg list
  - pick from an array
  - pick from a collection
  - pick a random integer between 0 and a single given value
  - random fraction 0 to 1 with no args
- Random element that gives the same value from its input until it is Reset OR until the value changes
- Functions inside functions
- Functions fix their arguments to get valueOf
- Click on a control in Navigator to add it to a formula
- Auto-complete to give a selection of possible names
- Runtime errors reported in the editor, with link to control
- Stop spell check errors in formulas
- Functions without brackets give error
- Error for reference to unknown property eg Data1.valu
- Wrap primitive results in a Proxy, so could do Set(data.x.y.z, 99)
- Null chaining - automatic?
- Allow quotes in Text
- Everything under the App Bar is available throughout the app
- Everything under the app, is available in the app bar
- Data at app level
- Live calculations at app level
- User-defined functions at app level
- Only allow $item in List item and list predicate/transform expressions
- Template vars in text content
- Avoiding floating point errors
- More argument checking at design time eg in Record Function
- Full type checking!
- Typed editors - popup properties editor forms based on the typof the function call or object
- Find a way to ensure that fixed values are the correct types (esp booleans) 
- Click on a name in a formula to go to its definition
