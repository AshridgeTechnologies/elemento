Initial apps website
--------------------
- ✅ Placeholder site on the web
- ✅ Can login with Google, Facebook or email/password

If necessary:
-------------
- All actions to set up an environment with the apps website must be in code
- The environment must be updatable with the same code
- Must be able to run the setup with just one script and the name of the environment 
BUT there is so little setup with Firebase it is probably not worthwhile

Setup required
--------------

- Authentication: enable and configure Email and Google providers
